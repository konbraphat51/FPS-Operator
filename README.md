# FPS-Operator
This is Unity demo FPS but Chat GPT is acting as an operator to support you.  
Enter your openAI API key into Assets/FPS/Scripts/GPT/GPTManager.cs  
  
If you only want the GPT API part, you may use Assets/FPS/Scripts/GPT/GPTManager.cs.
All you need is to call GPTManager.Instance.GetText()
